Real stories, real satisfaction - explore testimonials that reflect the quality, dedication, and excellence we strive to deliver.Sahitya Raj ACo-founderSreeal TechnologiesI attended Educosys live Generative AI online course, and despite not being a beginner in the field, I found it incredibly valuable for learners at all levels. The curriculum was well-structured, covering everything from basic neural networks to advanced frameworks and architectures.  One of the highlights was the transformer architecture, which was covered in remarkable depth with absolute clarity—no confusion, just a seamless understanding of self-attention, positional encoding, and how these models scale. And the way Keerti delivered it leaves a lasting impact—truly unmatched and unforgettable! Beyond the structured content, they also stretched beyond to cover the absolute latest - DeepSeek. Concepts that once felt intimidating now feel second nature.  An added bonus was the notes, which removed the overhead of excessive note-taking and allowed for more focused learning. The balance between theory and hands-on learning was perfect, making it easy to apply new knowledge in real-world projects. By the end of the course, I feel a significant boost in my confidence—whether at work, workshops, meetups, discussions, projects, or analyzing cutting-edge AI advancements.

Once the trend of AI started, I decided to build everything from scratch in AI. I began with Andrew Ng’s videos on YouTube, which were great, they covered machine learning algorithms well. But then I felt overwhelmed with deep learning. I started looking for simple videos that could help me truly understand deep learning and LLMs. That’s when I came across your YouTube video, Introduction to Machine Learning. I felt so happy and amazed, what took me almost a month to understand about supervised ML algorithms, you explained so clearly in just 23 minutes. After that, I was eagerly waiting for your next ML video. Then I found out that a Generative AI course was coming, and I was super excited and registered immediately. The course went far beyond my expectations. I was truly amazed by the difference before and after the course—I can now understand algorithms, transformer architecture, and ChatGPT in much more depth. And the most enjoyable part? The projects! I still can’t believe we built 10 hands-on projects—wow! I also loved the community this course created. The interactive nature, and the way Amit and the Educosys team responded to questions in the chat, was just amazing. I’d highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to work with LLMs in their workplace. I was especially impressed by how Keerti explained complex architectures in a way that’s easy to understand. She repeated key concepts and made sure everyone was following before moving on. She's such a dedicated teacher, and the whole team was incredibly supportive throughout.Read moreBalaji SriramQA Project ManagerAccion LabsI have been following Keerti’s YouTube videos for quite some time, but I was on a fix about joining the Hands-on Generative AI course. With so much happening in my professional and personal life, I was not sure if I could commit to 7 weeks. Looking back now, I’m so glad I signed up for this course. Many of the topics were new but all the sessions were engaging for me. Attending the live classes every day which has lots of revision and rewatching the recordings really helped me gain confidence. I have already started working on a few projects and that feels amazing to end this year on a positive note. A big thank you to Keerti for designing such a well-structured and inspiring learning experience. It truly made a difference in my AI learning journey. There were multiple revisions after each topic. Keerti encouraged the students to build their own projects and provided opportunities to showcase them during the live sessions - something I haven’t experienced in any other course.Read moreSouvik DasPrincipal Software EngineerDIRECTVEducosys has truly transformed the way I understand and apply Artificial Intelligence. The Generative AI course was a perfect blend of theory and hands-on learning - from understanding the foundations of LLMs to building real-world AI applications.

The curriculum was well-structured, covering everything from basic neural networks to advanced frameworks and architectures.  One of the highlights was the transformer architecture, which was covered in remarkable depth with absolute clarity—no confusion, just a seamless understanding of self-attention, positional encoding, and how these models scale. And the way Keerti delivered it leaves a lasting impact—truly unmatched and unforgettable! Beyond the structured content, they also stretched beyond to cover the absolute latest -\", 'these models scale. And the way Keerti delivered it leaves a lasting impact—truly unmatched and unforgettable! Beyond the structured content, they also stretched beyond to cover the absolute latest - DeepSeek. Concepts that once felt intimidating now feel second nature.  An added bonus was the notes, which removed the overhead of excessive note-taking and allowed for more focused learning. The balance between theory and hands-on learning was perfect, making it easy to apply new knowledge in real-world projects. By the end of the course, I feel a significant boost in my confidence—whether at work, workshops, meetups, discussions, projects, or analyzing cutting-edge AI advancements.  This course is truly for everyone, whether you’re getting started or deepening your expertise in Generative AI. Highly recommended!

And the way Keerti delivered it leaves a lasting impact—truly unmatched and unforgettable! Beyond the structured content, they also stretched beyond to cover the absolute latest - DeepSeek. Concepts that once felt intimidating now feel second nature.  An added bonus was the notes, which removed the overhead of excessive note-taking and allowed for more focused learning. The balance between theory and hands-on learning was perfect, making it easy to apply new knowledge in real-world projects. By the end of the course, I feel a significant boost in my confidence—whether at work, workshops, meetups, discussions, projects, or analyzing cutting-edge AI advancements.  This course is truly for everyone, whether you’re getting started or deepening your expertise in Generative AI. Highly recommended! Kudos to Keerthi and Amit for their incredible efforts in designing and delivering this course so beautifully, and for the vast amount of knowledge they have gathered and \\nAnswer:\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\n"
